### Extra functionality 

#### "Sand clock for a better score"
By eating the sand clock, we provided you a way to add each time +5 seconds to your game ! 
5 seconds may seems not much, but it's a lot in a Pacman life !

#### "SlowFast Motion"
Do you like to gamble ? Great we knew it ! 
We planed for you an option to eat the stopwatch, by eating it you are entering in a slowMotion (or a FastMotion !) mode !
During the next 6 seconds the ghost will go magically slow ! but, if the luck isn't on your side, the will go crazy and very fast !

#### "games of life and death"
You are probably wondering what does it mean. We will explain. You begin the game with 5 lives. Each time a ghost catch you, you have one life less than before !
So, in order to regain your power, we are giving you the opportunity to catch the pink arrowed heart, it will grant you +1 life ! 
Don't be hasty ! If you take the poison you are losing -1 life !
and.. since we know you love to gamble, you can take the mystery box, by taking it, you can gain up to +2 lives ! but also lose up to -2 lives !
So don't be reckless and play the game of life and death carefully ;)
